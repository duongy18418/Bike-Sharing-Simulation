# Bike Sharing Simulation

## 1. Project Overview
This project aimed to build a Agent-based Model that simulated the core mechanics of a bicycle sharing system (BSS). Furthermore, the project also assisted in identifying drawbacks with BSS and proposed the solutions.

## 2. Prerequisite
1. Install [Python 3.11.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3118/)
2. Install Requirements.txt ```pip install -r Requirements.txt```\
   a. If that doesn't work, run ```pip3 install -r Requirements.txt``` instead.
3. Install [AnyLogic](https://www.anylogic.com/)

## 3. Run Simulation
1. To run simulation 1, open Anylogic, navigate to the \GitHub\Bike-Sharing-Simulation\Bike Sharing Simulation folder, and use the Bike Sharing Simulation.alp file.
2. To run simulation 2, open Anylogic, navigate to the \GitHub\Bike-Sharing-Simulation\Final Model and Result\Bike_Sharing folder, and use the Bike_Sharing.alp file.
